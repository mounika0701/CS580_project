# CS580_project
This project focuses on implementing and evaluating algorithms for query processing on database systems. It includes solutions to various query processing problems such as evaluating line join queries, implementing simple join algorithms, and creating random datasets for testing purposes.

The repository includes:
- A hash join algorithms for evaluating queries.
- A simplified version of the Yannakakis algorithm for evaluating line join queries.

The algorithms are implemented in Python and MySQL.
